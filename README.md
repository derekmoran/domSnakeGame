# Snake Game

My take on a snake game written in the DOM using raw HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript

This was the product of a training and learning exercise: I just wanted to see if I could do it, and to ramp up my front-end skills in the process.
The code quality will surely reflect this context. Enjoy it for what it is :)

## System Requirements

Developed and tested on Chrome 110+
Does seems to work fine in Firefox 110+, Edge 110+, and Safari 16.3+
YMMV on other browsers

I've tried to make this responsive. It *should* work on resolutions as low as 320x568.
That said, the majority of mobile testing has been done in emulators.

## Known Issues

Mobile iOS devices do not allow preloading of audio. I found during testing that the audio does tend to kick in eventually, but initially there will be no sound.
